NOTES
TV remote
My TV remote control has arrow buttons and an OK button.
I can use these to move a "cursor" on a logical screen keyboard to type "words"...
The screen "keyboard" layout looks like this
a	b	c	d	e	1	2	3
f	g	h	i	j	4	5	6
k	l	m	n	o	7	8	9
p	q	r	s	t	.	@	0
u	v	w	x	y	z	_	/


Kata task

How many button presses on my remote are required to type a given word?
Notes

    The cursor always starts on the letter a (top left)
    Remember to also press OK to "accept" each character.
    Take a direct route from one character to the next
    The cursor does not wrap (e.g. you cannot leave one edge and reappear on the opposite edge)
    A "word" (for the purpose of this Kata) is any sequence of characters available on my virtual "keyboard"
